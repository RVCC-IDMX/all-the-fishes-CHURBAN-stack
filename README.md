# My Fish Tank Project:

## Coding Stategy:

My coding strategy for my project was to make a very unique and interesting fish tank environment without it making it look too busy. I designed the entire assignment around the televison fishtank background. I had to alter the x and y values within the index.html file to ensure that the sprites aka the fish would fit within the tv screen space where the water resides. It was quite easy to find fish that fit inside of my tank since that the space I needed to fill is quite small compared to some other tanks I saw on the internet. The fish that were used I had picked since I found the colors cool and interesting. I had used a carved piece of seaweed placed in the middle of the tank since I felt that it was the best use scenario that I could come up with. I had used an animation loop on the fish in the middle in order to make it seem like the fish was running. I then appplied a loop to the colorful fish on the right that results in the fish moving up and down which is what I wanted to see from the very beginning and it's as if the fish is moving farther into the tv-fish tank. The fish on the very left I had used one last annimation loop and that was simple since the fish only moves slightly but the movement is just enough to have the fish move at a slower paced speed. I had even decided to change the color of fish two from the original color of white to gold since it need a splash of color somewhere. The end result I am quite happy with and was proud about what I was able to accomplish since this is the first time that I have used PIXI.JS.

Within the fish there are mouse and click funtions present within the index.html file which then allow the user to be able to click on that fish 3 which allow the fish to move however you see fit. 

There is a slider in the middle of the screen and that enables a user to be able to manipluate and change the size of fish one without any hassle. 

Last but not least there is a button depicted in the top left corner and that button allows the user to be able to click on that multiple times and the color values on that singular fish will change however the user sees fit.
